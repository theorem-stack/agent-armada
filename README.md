## Problem Statement
Natural disasters present significant challenges for search and rescue operations, often leading to delayed response times, difficulties in locating victims, and increased risks for personnel operating in hazardous environments.

## Other Similar Problems
- **Search and Rescue:** Coordinating efforts to locate and assist individuals in emergencies.
- **National Park Monitoring:** Observing wildlife and monitoring environmental changes in vast and rugged terrains.
- **Military Reconnaissance:** Gathering intelligence in potentially dangerous zones while ensuring personnel safety.

## Solution
**AI Multi-Agent Systems** represent an innovative frontier in addressing these complex challenges. They offer the ability to:
- Rapidly search large and dense terrains, significantly improving operational efficiency.
- Enhance search effectiveness compared to a single manually operated drone or convential human search efforts.
- Minimize human risk in environments that are otherwise perilous for personnel.

### Traditional Difficulties of Multi-Agent Systems
- **Design Complexity:** Development can be intricate and often tailored to specific tasks.
- **Management Challenges:** Effective deployment requires sophisticated objective planning and resource allocation.
- **Limited Human Interface:** Many traditional robotic systems are either pre-programmed or require manual control, which can hinder adaptability and responsiveness in dynamic situations.

## System Solution
Utilizing an **LLM (Large Language Model)** as an interface between a human and a swarm of autonomous agents. The LLM interprets the human request, breaks down the request using Chain of Thought, and directs the swarm of autonomous agents.

### Benefits of LLM Interface
- **Natural Human Interface:** A complex swarm can easily be managed and directed using text or voice commands.
- **Dynamic Planning:** The LLM can dynamically assign roles and objectives to each agent based on the human command and available resources.
- **Feedback:** The LLM can collect and interpret swarm information, allowing the human to easily understand objective progress.

   ```

### Usage
After running the application, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Agent Armada interface.

## Acknowledgement of Moral Hazard
The application of dynamic, environment-agnostic autonomous drone swarms has numerous beneficial use cases, including natural disaster search and rescue, agriculture, infrastructure maintenance, and wildlife management. However, the potential for misuse in warfare and other harmful applications raises significant ethical concerns.
